# Prototype Notes


# Conversational Flow

The AI should ask (or alrady know) the below things about the user:
1. Food Allergies
2. Foods Dislike
3. Foods Like
4. How many meals per day (snacks included)?
5. Quick meals or coocked meals?
6. Goals: Brain focus, weight loss, muscle tone, hormone balance, etc. 
7. Bad habits they want to remove (such as sugar intake) and plan to help them achieve it. Gradual change not all at once into being healthy. 
8. Read body body scan information and provide feedabck on it. 

# Emotional Compannion through the process
The AI needs to accompany the user thorugh the transition of becoming healthy through: 
1. Using encouraging words.
2. Doing little rewards for them. 
3. Telling them what they could expect from their goles in a given timeline. 
4. Provide them with healthier alterantives to thier bad habits. 

# Progress tracker
1. I want the chatbot to check in and ask the user what did it eat so it can have an idea of how the user is going. 


# Technical Non Functional Requirements
1. User Log In (so that yu can have saved the information of the user).
